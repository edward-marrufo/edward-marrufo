## Edward M.

Hello!

My name is Edward and I'm passionate about tech.

- Outside of tech I have an interest in the outdoors such as hiking and fishing, cooking, pc gaming, Star Trek, music, and gardening.
- Currently I'm working on teaching myself Terraform and Kubernetes

### Why this page/account exists

- First and foremost I did not get here alone. The intent behind this is to house code and tutorials to give back to the community for those looking to get started in the tech industry or even those old timers looking to learn something new. It is my way of paying it forward when people took a chance on me a long time ago.
- Due to being busy I forget a lot of stuff if I don't use it consistently. It is easier to find things when they are organized as code rather than trying to remember that command which solves that weird issue I had a long time ago. Over time I also realized there exists a lot of knowledge in my head and it might be useful to someone if I write it down.
- When documentation is not updated it makes things more difficult for everyone involved. I want to make tech accessible to everyone, that is make it understandable and easy to follow without being overly complicated.
